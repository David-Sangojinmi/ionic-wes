He was firstly elected Prime Minister in 2013, and at 39 years old was one of the youngest world leaders, and the recipient the Outstanding Young Person of the Year. Dr. Muscat has left a strong mark both domestically and internationally. He recently sat at the very heart of EU policy-making, serving a term as President of the European Council in 2017. Malta’s presidency had several pressing issues on the agenda, including the migration crisis and the fight against terrorism. Domestically, his government has notably made considerable gains in civil rights. Malta has introduced same-sex marriage in July 2017, just one of several policies that led the UN to define the country ‘Gold Standard’ of LGBT rights. Dr. Muscat graduated with Honours from the University of Malta in Public Policy and later received a Master of European Studies. He also holds a Ph.D. in Management Research from the University of Bristol. Before his political career, Dr. Muscat worked as a journalist." ,

His talk will indeed focus on a very controversial topic he is currently researching: economic populism, which has come back strongly in the western world as the current economic insecurity fuelled demand for populist policies. Before coming to Warwick, Prof Herrera served various academic posts, including Associate Professor at HEC Montreal and Lecturer at Columbia University’s School of International and Public Affairs. He earned his undergraduate degree in Physics from the University of Pavia, and his PhD in Economics from New York University (NYU).

    "about": "Ian Cross is a medical doctor with Doctors Without Borders (MSF). With MSF Dr. Cross has worked at the very centre of what the UN describes as “the world’s fastest growing refugee crisis” – a crisis which has since August 2017 displaced near 600,000 Rohingya refugees from Myanmar who have crossed the border to Bangladesh to flee from violence and persecution. Having treated refugees and seen the many tragedies first hand Dr. Cross is uniquely positioned to offer insights into the abhorrent human rights crisis and MSF’s immense contribution to the affected minorities. Founded in 1971, MFS has continually helped tens of millions of people in more than 80 countries by providing medical care where it is most needed. MSF’s remarkable action in response to conflicts, epidemics and other catastrophes is rightfully reflected in its awarding of the Nobel Peace Prize in 1999 as well as the Indira Gandhi Prize in 1996. Since its establishment, the organization is not only committed to saving lives, but also exposing injustice, as ‘silence can kill’; such message is more than apposite today, and Dr. Cross is here promoting it in this year’s summit.",
